## About The Project

The Matrix-Space-Dashboard is a real-time, interactive web dashboard designed to visualize live space mission data. It provides a comprehensive and responsive platform for monitoring various aspects of space missions by fetching statistics from multiple space APIs, including NASA Open APIs and the SpaceX API.

This project aims to deliver a seamless experience for space enthusiasts, researchers, or anyone interested in live space telemetry, offering frequently updated data and engaging visualizations.

### Built With

* HTML5
* CSS3
* JavaScript (ES6+)
* React.js (Assumed, based on typical frontend development workflow for `npm start` and `localhost:3000/dashboard`)
* Chart.js or D3.js (for data visualization)
* NASA Open APIs
* SpaceX API
* Vercel (for hosting)

## Features

* **Real-time Data Updates:** Mission statistics are automatically updated every five minutes to ensure current and accurate information.
* **Interactive Charts:** Data is presented through dynamic and responsive charts for better understanding and engagement.
* **Mission Control Login:** Secure login and registration pages for managing access to the dashboard.
* **Dashboard Overview:** A central hub displaying key mission metrics, active missions, crew members, data collected, and system health.
* **ISS Tracker:** Real-time tracking and data related to the International Space Station.
* **Mars Weather Report:** Visualizations of recent weather conditions on Mars, including temperature and pressure trends.
* **Satellite Telemetry Monitoring:** Charts displaying simulated real-time telemetry data from satellites (e.g., temperature, power, signal strength).
* **Near-Earth Asteroid Tracker:** A table providing details on asteroids approaching Earth, including their size, velocity, and approach date.
* **Communication Signal Strength:** A chart illustrating the strength of communication signals over time.
* **Mission Status Distribution:** A pie chart showing the distribution of various mission statuses (Operational, Maintenance, Planning).
